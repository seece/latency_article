# Some latency measurements

This repository contains raw data for the measurements I made for the [DWM input latency article](http://www.lofibucket.com/articles/dwm_latency.html).

Data for each system is in its respective directory. The .csv file contains delays in seconds and the .out file containts lagmeasure's output.
